                "Training KM was the best decision I have ever made for my
                health as well as my safety. Without a doubt I am safer, feel
                braver but best of all it helps control my Fibromyalgia so now I
                have less pain. It helped restore my strength after major
                surgery too, stopping me feeling so vulnerable after being sick.
                I encourage everyone to treat Krav Maga as an important life
                skill that will benefit you for the rest of your life. Seize any
                opportunity with open arms to train with the excellent,
                welcoming and encouraging teachers at SKMS. Don't be timid! The
                company is great too- very sociable and warm hearted, you'll
                have so many laughs as they teach that you'll be amazed what you
                can do and how fast you learn skills. every single time you go,
                that could save your life. No one is competitive, age, height
                etc. doesn't matter because everyone helps each other, there's
                nothing I haven't liked about going to SKMS. I feel very lucky
                they crossed my path. ðŸ™‚"

                "I can thoroughly recommend the SKMS classes and tutors. I had
                some base in other martial arts but had none in Krav Maga.
                Finding a martial art which I could practice and work around a
                injured knee was my aim. I was also keen to build up my fitness
                after becoming a father. Before attending I contacted Robert who
                was very happy to discuss the ideology around Krav and my knee
                injury in particular. At my request I began with one private
                lesson which I really enjoyed. This is great value for money. I
                then attended a beginners class which was great fun with a good
                atmosphere. I am now about to attend a regular class. My
                experience is that the community and communication aspects are
                of a very high standard. The email and Whatsapp group are all
                very informative and welcoming."

                then we have both really enjoyed it, made friends, got fitter
                and traded bruises in a friendly atmosphere. The instructors are
                great and will encourage you to achieve your best and are always

                "krav" vibe that is connected to the sports itself, and you can
                find it in any country. Krav Maga has made me fitter, stronger
                and more self-confident. I feel like they should make it a
                mandatory subject in all schools. But until that has become a
