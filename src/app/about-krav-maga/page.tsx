      Krav Maga is the most effective self-defence system in the world. Krav
      Maga was first used by the military but has evolved into a system that can
      be used by civilians in their everyday lives. Krav Maga contains no
      sporting elements; it’s based on real life situations. It works! Krav Maga
      is focused on the body’s instinctive reaction to danger. Krav Maga
      techniques can be taught to anyone, regardless of sex, age or fitness
      levels. You don’t need to be fit to take part in a Krav Maga class; your
      fitness level will increase by practising the basic techniques. Krav Maga
      evolves to reflect the changes in the modern world. At SKMS our aim is to
      make Scotland a safer and fitter place to live. We teach our students
      about awareness, alertness and avoidance. The most effective form of
      self-defence is prevention. Rather than teaching our students how to
      confront attackers, we teach them how to de-escalate a situation; however,
      if this course of action fails, we make sure our students have the skills
      and confidence to deal with the situation. SKMS Krav Maga will bring out
      the best in you. We make Krav Maga accessible, affordable and fun. Our
      highly trained team are constantly updated and assessed to ensure that
      they deliver the best Krav Maga training in Scotland. We run classes from
      coast to coast, seven days a week. You can learn Krav Maga in a mixed
      class, a family class, or at one of our Women Only classes or with 1-2-1
      personal tuition at home or at your gym, the choice is yours. Book your
      trial today.
